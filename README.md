# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
This project is developed to participate in Entry level kaggle competition.

Dataset: Downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

Goal: My goal is to predict whether a passenger survive or not.

Methodolody:
1.Using feature according to choice(required tuning)
2.Created a model with 'ReLU' activation function for hidden layer and 'Sigmoid' for output layer.
3.Used 'categorical crossentropy' as loss function, 'RMSProp' as optimizer and 'accuracy' as metrics.
4.Got 78% accuracy.
5.Trying to get more accuracy
